# ðŸŽ¯ Assignment Overview

Create a Swift package named HealthMetricsKit that:
* Queries HealthKit for key daily health metrics:
    - Steps
    - Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
    - Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
    - VOâ‚‚Max
    - Sleep duration
* Handles HealthKit permissions.
* Exposes a HealthDataProvider protocol with:
    - A real implementation using live HealthKit data.
    - A mock implementation using static/deterministic values.

# ðŸ“± SwiftUI Demo App

Using your HealthMetricsKit, build a SwiftUI demo app that:
* Displays a simple dashboard summarizing one dayâ€™s worth of health
data.
* Uses the mock data provider.
* Focuses on:
    - Clean layout
    - Readable code structure
    - Native iOS UI/UX best practices
    - Good component separation and modularity

# ðŸ“¦  What to Submit

Please share a GitHub repository (public, or private with access granted) that
includes:
* HealthMetricsKit Swift package
* A SwiftUI demo app using mock data
* A README.md explaining your design, reasoning, and assumptions

Youâ€™re welcome to use any tools youâ€™d typically use on the job â€” including AI code
assistants â€” but weâ€™re especially interested in your ability to make strong
technical decisions, write clean and understandable code, and align with modern
iOS development patterns.
